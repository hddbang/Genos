## Model Introduction


**【Model Architecture and Technical Breakthrough】**

As a foundation model in the human genomics field, Genos is trained on hundreds of high-quality human genome reference datasets, achieving context modeling capabilities for human genomic sequences up to millions of base pairs. Through single-base resolution learning, the model has acquired the ability to identify deep sequence patterns and functional features hidden in the genome, building a new research approach for scientists to connect genetic information with life activities. This release includes two versions with 1.2 billion and 10 billion parameters, both adopting a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, achieving optimal computational resource allocation through dynamic routing mechanisms, significantly improving the model's performance in complex regulatory network analysis.

**【Functional Modules and Scientific Value】** 

Genos possesses the core capability to accurately identify key functional elements, enabling in-depth analysis of the cascading effects of minute genetic variations on transcriptional regulatory networks, breaking through the limitations of traditional methods in predicting regulatory elements in non-coding regions, dynamically simulating the potential impact of variant sites on RNA expression profiles, and tracing to the molecular pathways of phenotype formation. Based on this, the research team has developed modular application interfaces, constructing a full-chain research system of "prediction-explanation-verification". By introducing interpretability enhancement mechanisms, the model not only provides high-confidence prediction results but also reveals key nodes and action pathways in regulatory networks, providing a new research paradigm for molecular mechanism analysis.

**【Open Ecosystem and Clinical Translation】**

Adhering to the principles of open science, Genos provides open-source models on GitHub and Hugging Face, while simultaneously deploying cloud inference services on the DCS Cloud platform. Researchers can download models for deployment and inference, or choose to deploy on DCS Cloud. We also provide users with full-process analysis example code from variant functional annotation to phenotype prediction, helping users become familiar with model usage methods and functions more quickly. Model weights will be continuously updated, and their application potential in precision medicine, population health, monitoring, and developmental biology will be further released.

**【Scientific Philosophy and Future Prospects】**

Genos provides new possibilities for scientists to study the complex regulation of genes and their functional impacts. In the future, with the enhancement of cross-modal learning capabilities, Genos is expected to become a "translator" connecting genetic codes with life phenomena, opening new research dimensions in disease early warning, drug target discovery, and synthetic biology, aiming to achieve a paradigm shift from "genomics" to "functional genomics".

## Application Cases

### Case 1: RNA-seq Data Generation

1.  **Task Description**
    
    This task is based on Genos' extensive pre-training accumulation on genomic data, achieving direct prediction of single-base resolution RNA-seq expression profiles from DNA sequences through fine-tuning, covering multiple cell types and tissues. Its scientific significance lies in constructing a direct mapping relationship between genomic sequences and transcriptomic expression, providing an innovative tool for understanding gene regulatory mechanisms and accelerating transcriptomic research.
    
2.  **Task Input and Output**
    
    This task is a **regression task**. The task input is a partial sequence of the hg38 reference genome (currently using 32 kb as the window), and the output is the average normalized RNA-seq signal values (single-base precision) for different cell types, corresponding to sequence positions on the positive and negative strands of the genome. The core is to predict continuous transcriptomic expression levels by learning the complex mapping from sequence to expression.
    
3.  **Data Sources**
    
    Training data comes from public databases ENCODE (ENCODE Consortium, 2012) and GTEx (Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020).
    
    After integration, the data contains single-base transcriptomic bigwig files from 667 metadata groups, along with the hg38 reference genome as input. Model training uses all positional sequences on chromosomes 1-22 and their corresponding average RNA-seq profiles as paired data. The current public version uses 4 human B lymphocyte samples and 13 NK natural killer cell samples for fine-tuning. To remove inter-sample individual differences, expression data for both cell types are averaged across samples and normalized to one dataset each.
    
    \*The current public version can already perform prediction inference for human B lymphocytes and NK natural killer cells on chromosomes 1-22.
    
4.  **Model Design**
    

*   Downstream Model Architecture Design​
    

The model replaces the original output head with a task-specific convolutional module based on the pre-trained Genos-1.2B. This module consists of three one-dimensional convolutional layers with decreasing channel dimensions (1024→256→64→1), each followed by batch normalization, GELU activation, and dropout regularization (dropout=0.1). The final output is scaled by learnable weight parameters and passed through Softplus activation to ensure predicted values are non-negative continuous values, matching the regression characteristics of RNA-seq signals. This design enhances the model's ability to capture local sequence patterns while optimizing computational efficiency through the translation invariance of convolutions.

*   Fine-tuning Strategy and Training Optimization​
    

Full parameter fine-tuning is adopted, using mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function for the regression task. To address the skewed distribution of RNA-seq signal values, square root smooth clipping and power transformation are introduced during training for numerical compression, with inverse operations performed during inference to restore signal scale. The optimizer uses Adafactor, combined with a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler and linear warmup (warmup steps account for 5% of total steps), with global batch size set to 256, training for 60 epochs. This strategy ensures stable convergence while significantly reducing the risk of gradient fluctuations in long-sequence training.

*   Genomic Sequence Processing and Context Modeling​
    

To balance long-range dependency learning with computational cost, the input sequence window length is set to 32 kb, with adjacent windows overlapping by 16 kb, covering all sites on chromosomes 1-22.

(1).  **Metrics and Metric Definitions**
    

The core evaluation metric is the log1p-transformed Pearson correlation coefficient​. This metric is used to measure the consistency between model-predicted RNA-seq profiles and experimentally measured true profiles across different genomic ranges, with specific calculation ranges including:

*   Whole genome​: Genome-wide, single-base precision
    
*   Gene expression​: Gene expression matrix correlation, gene-level precision
    

\*The Pearson correlation coefficient is transformed by log1p (i.e., log(1 + r)) to better evaluate the global correlation of signal prediction.

(2).  **Evaluation Metrics**
Genos simulates and generates multi-cell type RNA-seq expression levels with correlation of 0.9+ compared to real sequencing results.

### Case 2: Genomic Model + Text Model Disease Prediction

#### Project Overview

**Introduction:**

This project aims to validate that multimodal models (genomic model + text model) can process raw DNA sequences in disease prediction tasks caused by genetic variants, while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate biologically consistent explanations and predictions.

![image.png](https://alidocs.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/res/NpQlK5jmkj0ADqDv/img/35006876-15a3-42be-9f1c-34167d2819cd.png)

**Data:**

Data comes from the KEGG task in the Bioreason paper [7], which integrates KEGG pathway and clinical database variant information through multiple stages, using standardized symbol systems to represent various interactions in molecular networks, providing comparisons between reference sequences and variant sequences. The KEGG dataset contains 1449 entries with 37 disease types, with data allocation of training:validation:test = 8:1:1. Data input includes problem descriptions, reference gene sequences, and variant gene sequences. Output includes reasoning and disease classification prediction.

**Model Design:**

*   Architecture design: DNA model, text model (Qwen3-1b, Qwen3-4b), projection layer from DNA embedding to text embedding.
    
*   Model training: This model training aims to achieve efficient alignment between DNA sequences and natural language. During training, the genomic model is frozen (supports Evo2, Genos models), the projection layer from DNA embedding to text embedding is trained, the text model is fine-tuned with LoRA, and DeepSpeed strategy is used for efficient training.
    
*   Genomic sequence processing: There are two gene sequences in total: 1. Reference gene sequence. 2. Variant gene sequence. A total of 1024 bp genomic sequence centered on the variant gene with upstream and downstream regions.
    

**Evaluation Metrics:**

*   **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted samples to total samples.
    

#### Results Comparison

The comparison of different models on the KEGG dataset is shown in the table below. Among genomic models, Genos-10B leads in performance, and text-genomic fusion models far outperform single-modal models. The 021-8B and Genos-1.2B fusion model achieves an accuracy of 98.28%, 7% higher than using Genos-1.2B alone.
